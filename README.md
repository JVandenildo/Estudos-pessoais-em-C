## Naming conventions for C

There isn't a universal convention for C, but there are some interesting minor conventions.

- **Variable** and **function** uses snake_case;
- **Macro** uses CamelCase;
- **Global variable** is interesting to have a prefix `g_` to indicate their global scope;
- **Static variables** is interesting to have a prefix `s_` to indicate their global scope;
- **Constants** are named with ALL_CAPS with underscores.
